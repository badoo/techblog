Yesterday I gave a talk to the London iPhone Developer Group ([#lidg](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lidg "Search Twitter for LiDG")) about the lessons we've learnt in the iOS team at Badoo as we've scaled the development team. 

Hopefully it was interesting to other developers; I certainly enjoyed talking to many of you afterwards. We're all facing the same challenges, and I think it's great to share these 'war stories'. And, I'll be looking to share more in the future.

I'm attaching the slides [here](/files/Scaling_Beyond_One_Developer.pdf "Scaling beyond one developer"), for those who are interested.
